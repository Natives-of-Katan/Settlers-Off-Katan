# Settlers-Off-Katan

## Project Description
Settlers Off Katan is a parody of the popular board game Settlers Of Catan, where players in the role of settlers build and develop settlements in an attempt to acquire the largest holdings. In our game, players take on the role of the original inhabitants of the land, and attempt to prevent settlers from taking over.
